# Digraph

Implementation for an immutable directed graph (often called "digraph"). An edge in the directed graph has a source and a target nodes. The given edge is designated as "outgoing edge" for the source node and as "incoming edge" for the target node. This directed graph implementation provides several add- and finder-methods for edges and nodes.
